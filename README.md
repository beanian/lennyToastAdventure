# Lenny Toast Adventure

This project uses the [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) framework to build a pixel art side-scrolling game that runs in desktop and mobile browsers.

## Development

Install dependencies and start a local server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser to view the placeholder game scene.
